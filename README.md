# NeuronBang
This project is about the neural circuits, neuronal conductivity and technologies.
For modeling of neural circuits is advantageous to use the program which was created by the Penn State University.

NeuronC is computer programm for modeling simulating large neural circuits.
Developed by <a href="http://retina.anatomy.upenn.edu/~rob/"> Robert Smith </a>
</p>

<h2> Installation </h2>

1. NeuronC runs under virtually any Unix system, and is currently developed under Linux
2. <a href="http://vrc.med.upenn.edu/files/nc.tgz"> Download </a> the NeuronC
3. Unzip the folder and install on you system

<h2> RUN </h2>
In order to run the calculation necessary to make following adjustments in the program:
1. Open the `makefile` ```[...nc/src]& vim makefile```
